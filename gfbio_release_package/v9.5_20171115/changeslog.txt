Improvement #1298 Improve Sign-in/Sign-up interfaces II
Registration/Sign-in:

    hide OpenId option
    limit input box length (it shold not always take the 90% width of the page)
    auto-generate screenname (no requirement to fill it) in registration
    no middlename (registration)
    no re-enter password box (registration)
    no text verification (registration)
    password policy will be displayed as a placeholder in the textbox, tooltip on mousehover and (only for a touch device) displayed as a text box on tap event

Footer

    sticky footer on sign-in/sign-up pages
    sign-up button redirect to create account UI, not sign-in
    reduce the height of the sign-up section to match with other columns
